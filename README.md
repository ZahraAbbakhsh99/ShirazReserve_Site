# ShirazReserve_Site

The source code of an online medical appointment platform in Shiraz called ShirazReserve, written in Python and the Django framework, is available to you. The page design is also coded with HTML5, CSS, and JS.

This site includes two features: registering appointments and viewing all registered appointments with a specific national code.

Which was prepared for the software laboratory course.

Thank you for your attention.
